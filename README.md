## Examples

### Type Checking

Demonstrates the use of type hints and type checking to ensure function arguments and return types are correct.

### Error Handling

Shows how to handle errors and exceptions gracefully, including custom exceptions and proper error messages.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Includes a comprehensive example of OOP in Python, with classes, methods, constructors, and proper encapsulation.

### Multithreading

Demonstrates how to use multithreading and asynchronous programming to run tasks concurrently and manage dependencies between threads.

### Decorators

Shows how to create and use decorators to log function calls and measure execution time.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Or to target a specific test:

```sh
python -m unittest tests.<test_file_name.py>
```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/polymood/beautiful-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd beautiful-python
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each feature is demonstrated in its respective module in the `src/` directory. You can run these modules directly to see the examples in action. For instance, to run the multithreading example:

```sh
python src/multithreading_example.py
```
